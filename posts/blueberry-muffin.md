**Ingredients**

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

**Instructions**

- Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) and grease a 12-cup muffin tin.
- In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
- In another bowl, whisk together the milk, melted butter, eggs, and vanilla extract.
- Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until just combined (don't overmix).
- Pour the batter into the muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full.
- Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
- Let the muffins cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy your muffins! You can add additional flavors by adding fruits, nuts, or chocolate chips to the batter.
